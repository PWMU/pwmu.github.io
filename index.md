### Presbyterian Womens Missionary Union was founded in 1890 to encourage prayerful interest in, and support for, missionaries of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria (PCV).
  
  
### PWMU membership is open to members and adherents of PCV congregations. 
  
    
    
### Members are usually organised into branches operating under the authority of the Session of the local congregation.

##

### Branches work together within Presbyteries as Presbyterial Associations (PAs)

##

### Members who are not able to join via a branch are recognised as individual "Lone" members

### Members receive regular news about

###         - missionaries supported and sponsored by the PCV

###         - organisations where PCV missionaries are serving

###         - PWMU activities across the State
