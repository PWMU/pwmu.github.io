## Presbyterian Womens Missionary Union was founded in 1890 to encourage prayerful interest in, and support for, missionaries of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria (PCV).

<br>
  
### PWMU membership is open to members and adherents of PCV congregations. 
  
  
    
### Members are usually organised into branches operating under the authority of the Session of the local congregation.



### Branches work together within Presbyteries as Presbyterial Associations (PAs)



### Members who are not able to join via a branch are recognised as individual "Lone" members   

<br>

### Members receive regular news about

** - missionaries supported and sponsored by the PCV **

** - organisations where PCV missionaries are serving **

** - PWMU activities across the State **
