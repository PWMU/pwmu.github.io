## The Presbyterian Womens Missionary Union was founded in 1890 to encourage prayerful interest in, and support for, missionaries of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria (PCV).

<br>
  
### PWMU membership is open to members and adherents of PCV congregations. 
  
  
    
### Members are usually organised into branches operating under the authority of the Session of the local congregation. If there is no branch close by, members may continue to receive newsletters and information direct to their own address (post or email).



### Branches work together within Presbyteries as Regional Associations (RAs)



<br>

### Members receive regular news about

- **missionaries supported and sponsored by the PCV**

- **organisations where PCV missionaries are serving**

- **PWMU activities across the State**


PWMU
